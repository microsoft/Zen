# Introduction 
Zen is a research library that aims to simplify the process of building verification tools. Zen lets users write a single implementation of a function and then execute, compile, and verify that function.

# Installation
Just add the project to your visual studio solution. A nuget package is available [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZenLib).

# Getting Started
To import the library, add the following line to your file:

```csharp
using ZenLib;
using static ZenLib.Language;
```

The main abstraction Zen provides is through the type `Zen<T>` which represents a value of type `T` that can be either concrete or symbolic. As a simple example, consider the following code:

```csharp
Zen<int> MultiplyAndAdd(Zen<int> x, Zen<int> y)
{
    return 3 * x + y;
}
```

This is a function that takes two Zen parameters (x and y) that represents an integer values and returns a new Zen value of type integer by multiplying x by 3 and adding y to the result. Zen overloads common C# operators such as `&,|,^,<=, <, >, >=, +, -, *, true, false` to work over Zen values and supports implicit conversions between literals and Zen values. 

The next step is to create a `ZenFunction`:

```csharp
var function = Function<int, int, int>(MultiplyAndAdd);
```

Given a `ZenFunction` we can leverage the library to perform multiple tasks. The first is to simply evaluate the function on a collection of inputs:

```csharp
var output = function.Evaluate(3, 2); // output = 11
```

To perform verification, we can ask Zen to find us the inputs that leads to something being true:

```csharp
var input = function.Find((x, y, result) => And(x >= 0, x <= 10, result == 11)); // input.Value = (0, 11)
```

The type of the result in this case will be `Option<(int, int)>`, which will have a pair of integer inputs that make the expression true if such a pair exists.

Finally, Zen can compile the function to generate IL at runtime that executes without a performance penalty.

```csharp
function.Compile();
output = function.Evaluate(3, 2); // output = 11
```

Comparing the performance between the two:

```csharp
var watch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew();

for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) function.Evaluate(3, 2);

Console.WriteLine($"interpreted function time: {watch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms");
watch.Restart();

function.Compile();
Console.WriteLine($"compilation time: {watch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms");
watch.Restart();

for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) function.Evaluate(3, 2);

Console.WriteLine($"compiled function time: {watch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms");
```

```
interpreted function time: 4601ms
compilation time: 4ms
compiled function time: 2ms
```

# Supported Types

Zen currently supports the following primitive types: `bool, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong`.
It also supports values of type `Tuple<T1, T2>`, `ValueTuple<T1, T2>`, `Option<T>`, `IList<T>` and `IDictionary<T>` so long as the inner types are also supported. Zen has some limited support for `class` and `struct` types; it will attempt to model all public fields and properties. The class/struct must also have a default constructor.

# Examples

### Insertion sort

As a simple example, we can use Zen to verify and extract an implementation of the [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) sorting algorithm. First we must implement the insertion sort algorithm. While Zen does not support looping constructs (for, while) it does support recursion through C# in the style of functional programming languages. Below is a simple implementation of insertion sort:

```csharp
Zen<IList<T>> Sort<T>(Zen<IList<T>> expr)
{
    return expr.Case(empty: EmptyList<T>(), cons: (hd, tl) => Insert(hd, Sort(tl)));
}

Zen<IList<T>> Insert<T>(Zen<T> element, Zen<IList<T>> expr)
{
    return expr.Case(
        empty: Language.Singleton(element),
        cons: (hd, tl) =>
            If(element <= hd, expr.AddFront(element), Insert(element, tl).AddFront(hd)));
}
```

Now to prove that the result of the sort is correct, we can write a second function: 

```csharp
private static Zen<bool> IsSorted<T>(Zen<IList<T>> expr)
{
    return expr.Case(
        empty: true,
        cons: (hd1, tl1) =>
            tl1.Case(empty: true,
                     cons: (hd2, tl2) => And(hd1 <= hd2, IsSorted(tl1))));
}
```

Finally, we can ask Zen to prove that the list will always be sorted and extract an implementation.

```csharp
var function = Function(Sort<int>);
var input = function.Find((l, b) => Not(IsSorted(b)));  // input.HasValue == false

// extract an implementation
function.Compile();
Func<IList<int>, IList<int>> implementation = function;
```

Behind the scenes Zen is using [bounded model checking]() to perform verification. For lists, it only finds examples up to a given input size, which is configurable.


### Network access control lists (ACLs)

As another example, the following shows how to use Zen to encode and then verify a simplified network access control list that allows or blocks packets using an ordered collection of rules.

```csharp
public class Packet
{
    public uint DstIp { get; set; }
    public uint SrcIp { get; set; }
}

public class Acl
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public AclLine[] Lines { get; set; }

    public Zen<bool> Matches(Zen<Packet> packet)
    {
        return Matches(packet, 0);
    }

    private Zen<bool> Matches(Zen<Packet> packet, int lineNumber)
    {
        if (lineNumber == this.Lines.Length) 
        {
            return false;
        }

        var line = this.Lines[lineNumber];
        return If(line.Matches(packet), line.Permitted, this.Matches(packet, lineNumber + 1));
    }
}

public class AclLine
{
    public bool Permitted { get; set; }
    public uint DstIpLow { get; set; }
    public uint DstIpHigh { get; set; }
    public uint SrcIpLow { get; set; }
    public uint SrcIpHigh { get; set; }

    public Zen<bool> Matches(Zen<Packet> packet)
    {
        var dstIp = packet.GetField<Packet, uint>("DstIp");
        var srcIp = packet.GetField<Packet, uint>("SrcIp");
        return And(dstIp >= this.DstIpLow,
                   dstIp <= this.DstIpHigh,
                   srcIp >= this.SrcIpLow,
                   srcIp <= this.SrcIpHigh);
    }
}
```

# Implementation
Zen builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the function it is representing and then leverages C#'s reflection capabilities to interpret, compile, and symbolically evaluate the AST.

The `Find` function uses symbolic model checking to exhaustively search for inputs that lead to a desired result. In the backend it supports two solvers, one based on SMT solvers such as [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) and another based on binary decision diagrams.
